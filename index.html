								The Barbie doll was invented in 1959 by Ruth Handler 
								(co-founder of Mattel), whose own daughter was called 
								Barbara. Barbie was introduced to the world at the 
								American Toy Fair in New York City. Barbie's job was 
								teenage fashion doll. The full name of the first doll 
								was Barbie Millicent Roberts, from Willows, Wisconsin.

						In 1958, English pictorial photographer Henry Peach Robinson 
						created the world’s first photomontage by combining five 
						different negatives to make one complete print of a young 
						girl on her deathbed. “Fading Away”—Robinson’s first and 
						most famous composite photo—depicts a young girl dying of 
						consumption and was controversial when it was exhibited, with 
						many believing it was not a suitable subject for photography.

						Staying afloat

					<p>
						Lobsterman John Aldridge fell into the shark-infested water of 
						Long Island while his crewmates were asleep. He was kept afloat 
						for more than 12 hours by his rubber boots, which he used as 
						flotation devices. The coast guard rescued him 43 miles south 
						of Montauk where he fell off his vessel.

					On the night of Aug 8, 1975, a line of people frantically piled sandbags 
					atop Henan Province's <b>Banqiao Dam</b> while being battered by the worst storm 
					ever recorded in the region. They were in a race with the rapidly rising 
					Ru River to save the dam and the millions of people that lay sleeping 
					downstream. It was a race they were about to lose.
				</p>

				<p class="para-2">
					Just after 1:00 am, the sky cleared and stars emerged from behind the storm 
					clouds. There was an eerie calm as someone yelled, <q>"The water level is 
					going down! The flood is retreating!"</q>
				</p>

				<p class="para-3">
					There was little chance to enjoy that calm. One survivor recalled that a 
					few seconds later it <q>"sounded like the sky was collapsing and the earth was 
					cracking."</q> The equivalent of 280,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools burst 
					through the crumbling dam, taking with it entire towns and as many as 171,000 
					lives.
