					The Barbie doll was invented in 1959 by Ruth Handler 
					(co-founder of Mattel), whose own daughter was called 
					Barbara. Barbie was introduced to the world at the 
					American Toy Fair in New York City. Barbie's job was 
					teenage fashion doll. The full name of the first doll 
					was Barbie Millicent Roberts, from Willows, Wisconsin.

					In 1958, English pictorial photographer Henry Peach Robinson 
					created the world’s first photomontage by combining five 
					different negatives to make one complete print of a young 
					girl on her deathbed. “Fading Away”—Robinson’s first and 
					most famous composite photo—depicts a young girl dying of 
					consumption and was controversial when it was exhibited, with 
					many believing it was not a suitable subject for photography.

					Staying afloat

				<p>
					Lobsterman John Aldridge fell into the shark-infested water of 
					Long Island while his crewmates were asleep. He was kept afloat 
					for more than 12 hours by his rubber boots, which he used as 
					flotation devices. The coast guard rescued him 43 miles south 
					of Montauk where he fell off his vessel.

			<h3>
				Overflow
			</h3>

			<p>
				On the night of Aug 8, 1975, a line of people frantically piled sandbags 
				atop Henan Province's Banqiao Dam while being battered by the worst storm 
				ever recorded in the region. They were in a race with the rapidly rising 
				Ru River to save the dam and the millions of people that lay sleeping 
				downstream. It was a race they were about to lose.
			</p>

			<p>
				Just after 1:00 am, the sky cleared and stars emerged from behind the storm 
				clouds. There was an eerie calm as someone yelled, <q>"The water level is 
				going down! The flood is retreating!"</q>
			</p>

			<p>
				There was little chance to enjoy that calm. One survivor recalled that a 
				few seconds later it <q>"sounded like the sky was collapsing and the earth was 
				cracking."</q> The equivalent of 280,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools burst 
				through the crumbling dam, taking with it entire towns and as many as 171,000 
				lives.
